Directly Addressable Codes (DACs):
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Directly Addressable Codes (DACs) consist in a variable-length encoding
scheme for integers that enables direct access to any element of the
encoded sequence and obtains compact spaces.

and

This version obtains the optimal space for the representation of
integers with no further restriction.

The software is under GNU/GPL v3 and comes without any warranty.



Source Code Included:
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

The folder src contains the source code for DACs.
More concretely, the use of DACs require the following files:
basics.c  basics.h  bitrankw32int.c  bitrankw32int.h  constants.h  dacs.c  dacs.h  

We also include a testing program, test.c, that generate a binary file, test,
to show how to use DACs' interface.


Compiling:
-=-=-=-=-

For compiling execute 'make'. With 'make clean' you can erase binary files.


Usage example:
-=-=-=-=-=-=-
For testing the source code use the binary file generated:
$ ./test <integer list file>  <outfile>


The input format for the integer list is a binary file containing a 4 bytes field
for each integer.

It saves DACs' representation of the integer list in <outfile>.
